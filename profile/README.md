This GitHub organization collects repositories containing [CLDF](https://github.com/cldf) datasets. To suggest cross-linguistic datasets
(whether already formatted as CLDF or not) for addition, open an issue at https://github.com/cldf-datasets/cldf-datasets/issues

Organizations grouping specific types of CLDF data are
- [lexibank](https://github.com/lexibank) for [CLDF Wordlists](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/tree/master/modules/Wordlist) or
- [dictionaria](https://github.com/dictionaria/) for [CLDF Dictionaries](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/tree/master/modules/Dictionary).
